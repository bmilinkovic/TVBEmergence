## TVB Emergence

This code utilises an integration between Python and MATLAB code. 

The Virtual Brain (TVB) platform is used to simulated large-scale brain network models utilising a variety of neural mass models.

Then, the python code is piped to MATLAB commands that run state-space dynamical independence to discover macroscopic variables from (G-)causal graphs.

Importantly, it has several dependencies:

1. Multivariate Granger Causality Toolbox (Barnett & Seth, 2014)
2. State-space Dynamical Independence Toolbox (Barnett, 2021)
3. gpmat:
