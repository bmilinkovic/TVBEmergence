## TVB Emergence

This code integrates Python and MATLAB to simulate and analyze large-scale brain network models.
- The Virtual Brain (TVB) platform is used to simulate biophysical neural models at the macroscopic scale, employing various neural mass models.
- The Python code interfaces with MATLAB to run state-space Dynamical Independence (DI) analysis, identifying macroscopic variables from Granger-causal graphs.
