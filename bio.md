{just call me Boki =]}

I am an overly-excited and eclectic PhD Candidate at the University of Melbourne in Computational & Theoretical Neuroscience
primarily exploring how we can quantify emergence in neural systems to better inform scientific theories of consciousness.

I know what you're thinking: that's a dense sentence. So let me try be more specific, and hopefully, even denser. On a 
daily basis I try to simulate large-scale brain network models where each node in the network is defined by a neural mass model.
Neural mass models is just a fancy name for models that define neural population dynamics. Now, if we interconnect these models
into a network that is informed by structural brain data, we can simulate macroscopic large-scale activity that emerges from the 
coupling, that is not necessarily attributable to the local node dynamics alone. 

The study of this kind of collective behaviour is philosophically and scientifically understood as the study of emergence:
how some macroscopic phenomena emerges from the interactions of the microscopic composite parts. 

I am interested in understanding emergence from the point-of-view of a very powerful framework called information theory. 
To that end, I apply information-theoretic measures of emergence to the simulated dynamics I have mentioned above and to 
electrophysiological data such as EEG. EEG is cool because we really are picking up the temporal evolution of brain dynamics 
_as they happen_. 

In the wider scope, at which I'm sure to continue failing at, I wish to consolidate dynamical systems approaches and 
information-theoretic approaches to collective behaviour. I further want to really explore the utility of emergence measures
in empirical electrophysiological data and understand if an _emergence landscape_ (there's another annoying neologism) changes across 
different global states of consciousness such as wakefulness, sleep, anesthesia, coma and even psychedelic experiences.

Outside of my little silo of scientific pursuits, I am interested in complex systems in general and consciousness science. 
I tend to enjoy coding and optimising my workflow to create readable and reusable open-source code. 

I have a severe passion for teaching, which I developed through training martial arts (Ryu-Kyu Okinawan Shido-kan Karate 
if you might be interested). Currently, I tutor Statistics and Personality & Social Psychology. I am also the Media Coordinator
of Melbourne-Monash Consciousness Research collective which promotes interdisciplinary research in consciousness ranging from
neuroscience, psychology, computer science, philosophy, art and medicine.

I am always happy to connect with other interested in similar topics, or even those that have productive critiques, so please
reach out if you want to get in touch!
